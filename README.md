# Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling (Self Projct)

## Bank Personal Loan Modelling and Prediction | Machine Learning Classification Self Project	 - Jun’21

**Objective**
- Devise a **classifying model** using ML algorithms to predict the likelihood of a customer buying personal loan <br/>

**Approach**
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** to observe the relationship between different attributes of the dataset <br/>
- Transformed & pre-processed data by converting categorical features to binary values using **one-hot encoding** <br/>
- Employed various classification models viz. **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN** & **Naïve Bayes** <br/>
- Trained all models on **10-fold cross-validated** dataset & used **ROC curve, confusion matrix** for model selection <br/>

**Conclusion** 
- Enumerated precision results & achieved highest F1-score between **0.85-0.95** for **Random Forest Model**
